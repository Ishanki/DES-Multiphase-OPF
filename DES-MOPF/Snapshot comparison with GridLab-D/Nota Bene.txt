For the 'On Peak' snapshot at t=566, the constraint imposing a voltage upper bound was removed.
This is indicated in the results file name as "noVUB".
GridLab-D does not impose such an upper bound in its simulations, and this is evident 
because voltage magnitudes above the usual network upper bound are recorded in its solution.
Removing this constraint in the MOPF formulation in this instance facilitates the comparison of solutions.
